# Space Invaders for David (a friend)
A classic Space Invaders clone made using Pygame. This is a project features colorful graphics, sounds, power-ups, and more. The goal is to fend off waves of enemy invaders while avoiding enemy fire and collecting power-ups.

## What I learned
- `Pygame` library
- Game development
- Object Oriented Programming

## Game Overview
- The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen. The objective is to destroy waves of enemy invaders before they reach the bottom or destroy your bases.
- Enemies shoot back at the player and will destroy the player's base if not stopped.
- Power-ups can be collected to help the player, such as extra lives or enhanced firepower.

# Space Invaders for David (a friend)
A classic Space Invaders clone made using Pygame. This is a project features colorful graphics, sounds, power-ups, and more. The goal is to fend off waves of enemy invaders while avoiding enemy fire and collecting power-ups.

## What I learned
- Pygame: Gained hands-on experience with the Pygame library for creating 2D games.
- Game Development: Developed an understanding of game mechanics, collision detection, and sprite management.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Applied OOP principles to structure the game, manage entities like the player, enemies, bullets, and power-ups.

## Game Overview
- The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen. The objective is to destroy waves of enemy invaders before they reach the bottom or destroy your bases.
- Enemies shoot back at the player and will destroy the player's base if not stopped.
- Power-ups can be collected to help the player, such as extra lives or enhanced firepower.
